The Open Manuscripts initiative is using [the CITE architecture](http://cite-architecture.github.io/) to organize information about manuscripts, collaboratively assembled  from several related projects.

The coordinated projects include:


1. Sources for [openly licensed images](http://openmss.github.io/img_sources/) of manuscripts
2. [Documentation about manuscripts](http://openmss.github.io/mss/) illustrated by openly licensed images
3. [Cataloging contents of manuscripts](http://openmss.github.io/msscatalog) illustrated by openly licensed images
4. Structured [paleogaphic obversations](http://openpaleography.github.io) linked to canonically cited images
5. Diplomatic editions of texts in manuscripts
6. Translations of diplomatic editions
